Plan of attack

# Step 1: Train neural net

## Fine tune model

### Figure out network stuff (e.g., Google collab)
### Make training data processable
### Train new parameters

## Get model to output correct number of letters

## Get model to assign probabilities / feasibilities to proposed answers

# Step 2: Joint estimation

## 

## Produce ordered list of likeliest N answers
